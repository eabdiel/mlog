#Mlog xD 
Based on the microblogging sample_app created by Michael Hartl on his "Ruby on rails tutorial : learn rails by example"
Mlog xD will be the administrative site that will ultimately control the functions of the future mobile
application.  
The site is designed to act as the main database for every mobile blogger.
